📝 ✅ User Story: Add QUOTE Field ID to the UI with Validation
User Story
As a user managing project quotes,
I want to enter a unique Quote Field ID on the UI,
so that each quote can be distinctly tracked and referenced across the system.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
A new input field labeled Quote Field ID is added to the Quote creation/edit form.

The field must be:

Required.

Unique (no duplicate IDs in the system).

Alphanumeric, 6–10 characters.

If a duplicate or invalid ID is entered, an inline error is shown with a helpful message.

The field is validated on both client and server side.

The UI should prevent submission unless the Quote Field ID is valid and unique.

The field is stored in the backend database upon successful submission.

The field is displayed in the quote summary and searchable in the list view.
